"""Check your model before you spend anything real: `make ping`.

Two tiny calls through the same client and backend your ways use. The first
offers one tool and asks the model to call it; the second sends the tool's
result back and asks for a one-word answer. Together they cost a fraction of a
cent, and they prove the four things the assignment depends on: your key works, the
model is the one you chose, it calls tools, and pricing.yaml has its line.
